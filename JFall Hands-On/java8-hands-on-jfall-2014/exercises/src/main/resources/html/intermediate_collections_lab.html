<a href="index.html">index</a><h1>Lab: Intermediate collections</h1><h2>Introduction</h2><p>In this lab you will learn more advanced features on streams. In this exercise we will use the following simple domain:</p><p><code>
Company ---- employees ---- Person  
</code></p><p>So a company has a list of employees and a employee has a name, age, gender and a role (for example programmer)</p><p>Sources: <code>com.xebia.java8_3.collections.IntermediateCollectionsLab</code><br/>Tests: <code>com.xebia.java8_3.collections.IntermediateCollectionsLabTest</code></p><h2>Exercises</h2><h3>1. Implement personToString</h3><p>Implement the method <code>personToString</code> which requires you to write a new collector which prints out the name(uppercase) and the gender and age as a comma separated string.</p><p>Example:</p><p><code>Person p = new Person(&quot;Frank&quot;, 32, true) should create: (FRANK -&gt; M),</code></p><p>Hint: Look at the method signature of <code>Collector#of(java.util.function.Supplier, java.util.function.BiConsumer, java.util.function.BinaryOperator, java.util.stream.Collector.Characteristics...)}</code></p><h3>2. Implement removeYoungestAndOldestChildrenFromList</h3><p>Implement the method <code>removeYoungestAndOldestChildrenFromList</code> which removes the youngest and the oldest persons from the list.</p><p>Hint: take a look at <code>IntSummaryStatistics</code> and use a collector to collect these statistics.</p><h2>Grouping</h2><p>The next three exercises use the groupingBy method. The last one is more complicated.</p><h3>3. Implement groupByNamesOfEmployee</h3><p>Implement the method <code>groupByNamesOfEmployee</code> which will return a map with the key the name of the person and the value a list of persons with that name.</p><h3>4. Implement groupByAdultsAndMinors</h3><p>Group the list of persons in adults and minors the result has to be a Map with key: 'adults' or 'minors' and value the list of persons belonging to the classifier.</p><h3>5. Implement findWhichRoleIsMostPopularAcrossCompanies</h3><p>Implement the method <code>findWhichRoleIsMostPopularAcrossCompanies</code> which will return the role which is most available across companies.</p><h3>6. Implement findCompanyWithOldestEmployee</h3><p>Implement the method <code>findCompanyWithOldestEmployee</code> which finds the oldest employee over all the companies. Hint: Don't forget you need to keep track of the company grouping on age will loose the companies. </p><h2>New methods which will operate on streams</h2><p>In the next exercises we will create new methods which will operate on streams.</p><h3>7. Implement takeWhile</h3><p>Implement the method <code>takeWhile</code> which continues consuming elements of the stream until the predicate returns <code>false</code>.</p><p>Hint: take a look at the <code>Spliterators</code> class.</p><h3>8. Implement zip</h3><p>Implement the method <code>zip</code> which creates a combined Stream whose elements are the result of combining the elements of two streams. The function will be applied until one of the streams is exhausted.</p><p>Hint: take a look at the test cases first to get a feeling on how the <code>zip</code> method should work</p><h3>9. Implement zipWithSum</h3><p>Implement this method which will take two streams of integers and returns a new stream by applying a stream which sums the elements of the <code>zip</code> method. </p><br/>
